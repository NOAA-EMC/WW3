# The WAVEWATCH III Framework

WAVEWATCH III<sup>&reg;</sup>  is a community wave modeling framework that includes the 
latest scientific advancements in the field of wind-wave modeling and dynamics.

## General Features

WAVEWATCH III<sup>&reg;</sup> solves the random phase spectral action density 
balance equation for wavenumber-direction spectra. The model includes options 
for shallow-water (surf zone) applications, as well as wetting and drying of 
grid points. Propagation of a wave spectrum can be solved using regular 
(rectilinear or curvilinear) and unstructured (triangular) grids. See 
[About WW3](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/WW3/wiki/About-WW3) for a 
detailed description of WAVEWATCH III<sup>&reg;</sup> .

## Installation

The WAVEWATCH III<sup>&reg;</sup>  framework package has two parts that need to be combined so 
all runs smoothly: the GitHub repo itself, and a binary data file bundle that 
needs to be obtained from our ftp site. Steps to successfully acquire and install 
the framework are outlined in our [Quick Start](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/WW3/wiki/Quick-Start)
guide.
