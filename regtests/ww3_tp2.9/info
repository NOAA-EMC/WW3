#          rect_2d.obs and rect_2d.mask respectively                        #
#      + Spectral grid: ntheta = 36, nf = 3, f1 = 0.035 fgamma = 1.1        #

#      + Spatial grid: 121 x 121 Curvilinear LL grid                        #
#        - dx and dy are variable. The grid is set in the shape of a        #
#          quarter annulus. The formulation used to build the x and y grids #
#          is as follows                                                    #
#          theta = [0:0.75:90] (in degrees)                                 #
#          R = [5:0.25:35]                                                  #
#          x(i,j) = 195+R(i)*cos(theta(j))                                  #
#          y(i,j) = -30+R(i)*sin(theta(j)) (repeat for all i,j)             #
#        - x and y grids are curv_2d.lon and curv_2d.lat                    #
#        - bottom, obstruction and mask grids are defined as for the        #
#          rectlinear grids but with a file prefix of curv_2d               #
#      + Spectral grid: Same as the rectilinear grid                        #
#    * The obstruction grids used here have been developed using the        #
#      gridgen software that has been adapted to work with curvilinear      #
#      grids.                                                               #
#    * The runs are initialized by a narrow banded spectrum with an         #
#      Hs = 4m everywhere, propagating in the SW direction (this can be     #
#      changed in ww3_strt.inp)                                             #
#    * The masks have been given a value of 2 (denoted boundary points)     #
#      along the edges. In the absence of nest files this ensures that the  #
#      initial wave spectrum is maintained along the edges for the duration #
#      of the run (thus allowing for steady state conditions to develop)    # 
#   * switch options (mostly self-explanatory).                             #
