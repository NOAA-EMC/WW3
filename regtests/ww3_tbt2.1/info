#  Initial condition (hour 0) is uniform field of SWH=1 m, waves            #
#  propagating from the SE to NW. S&E boundaries are held constant (i.e.    #
#  not updated). At first time step, waves are eliminated inside the domain #
#  by an ice field. So at this time, SWH is 1 m at S and E boundaries, but  #
#  zero in the interior. After that time, it is a case of swell propagating #
#  from SE to NW. Mud is defined in the NW quadr. The interior of the swell #
#  field is uniform until it enounters the mud, which happens around hr 9.  #
#  The swells are dissipated over the mud patch (NW quadrant). By hour 24,  #
#  the results are almost stationary: uniform SWH outside the mud field and #
#  gradual damping (from SE to NW) over the mud field. Note: ice is used    #
#  in this case simply as a mechanism to eliminate wave energy at the first #
#  time step and this test case is not concerned with the physics of waves  #
#  through ice.                                                             #
