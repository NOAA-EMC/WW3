# -netCDF4 librairies must be installed and NETCDF variables setup          #

# Description                                                               #
#   Test case is for wind-wave growth in the Adriatic Sea near the ISMAR    #
#   research platform Acqua Alta, where space-time extremes measurements    #
#   have been performed. Model outputs include space-time extremes          #
#   parameters as follows:                                                  #
#     STMAXE     MXE   Max surface elev (STE)                               #
#     STMAXD     MXES  St Dev of max surface elev (STE)                     #
#     HMAXE      MXH   Max wave height (STE)                                #
#     HCMAXE     MXHC  Max wave height from crest (STE)                     #
#     HMAXD      SDMH  St Dev of MXC (STE)                                  #
#     HCMAXD     SDMHC St Dev of MXHC (STE)                                 #
#                                                                           #
# Wind data for this test case was produced by the COSMO-ME model, and have #
# been provided by CNMCA (National Meteorological Service, Rome, Italy).    #
#                                                                           #
# Additionally, a wind stress-driven test with variable air density field   #
# is included. At the moment the test is still wind-driven as the stress-   #
# driven case is not fully implemented, but it is included to check that    #
# the stress is properly read, interpolated, and written to the output.     #
# Wind stress and density data were provided by the Met Office by modifying #
# the wind data used to run the wind-driven test.                           #
#                                                                           #
# Model results are presented here for the purpose of testing               #
# the formulations of space-time extreme parameters. This regression test   #
# oversimplifies real-case bathymetry and wind fields, thus comparison with #
# measurements are merely qualitative.                                      #  
#                                                                           #
