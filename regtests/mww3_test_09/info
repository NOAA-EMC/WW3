#   Only three lakes out of the 5 Great Lakes are included in this test.    #
#   All lakes are on 4-level SMC grids at resolution 0.5-1-1-4 km.          # 
#   Sub-grids are identified by Michi for Lake Michigan;                    # 
#                               Huron for Lake Huron;  and                  #
#                               Super for Lake Superior.                    #
#                                                                           #
#   Spectral grid: ntheta = 36, nf = 30, f1 = 0.004118, fgamma = 1.1        #
#                                                                           #
#   One sample job script subGtLksgrid is provided for generating the       #
#   mod_def.ww3 file for each sub-grid.  It needs to be modified for your   #
#   local pathes and operating systems.                                     #
#                                                                           #
#   One gif figure is also provided for view of the grid.  Filled red cells #
#   are boundary cells for exchange of wave spectra during the run.         #
#                                                                           #
