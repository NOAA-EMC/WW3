$ cat grdset_a
MODEL: global arctic
INPUT:
POINT: global arctic
6a: full blown (but progagation-only) simulation with irregular arctic grid from tp2.5, includes bathymetry from DBDB2 and the full 0.5 degree global grid
arctic: curvilinear grid, 361 x 361
"tps2" version includes winds from NOGAPS, ice from PIPS ; this is a 12 hour simulation.

$ cat grdset_b
MODEL: gband arcticreg
INPUT:
POINT: gband arcticreg
6b,c, regular grids only
6b uses realistic depths, taken from DBDB2
arcticreg : regular grid, 201 x 91

$ cat grdset_c
MODEL: gbandd360 aregd360
INPUT:
POINT: gbandd360 aregd360
6b,c, regular grids only
6c uses deep water.
aregd360: regular grid, 201 x 91

$ cat grdset_d
MODEL: gbandd360 arcticsub
INPUT:
POINT: gbandd360 arcticsub
6d:  like 6a, but both grids have been reduced in size, and bathymetry omitted (deep water).
arcticsub : curvilinear, 107 x 121
"tps" version includes winds from an idealized cyclone

$ cat grdset_e
MODEL: gbandd_1p0 arctic_int
INPUT:
POINT: gbandd_1p0 arctic_int
6e: a test case that is of intermediate computation time between 6d (fast) and 6f (slow) (with 6a also being slow)
arctic_int : curvilinear, 361 x 128

$ cat grdset_f
MODEL: gbandd_1p0 arcticd
INPUT:
POINT: gbandd_1p0 arcticd
arcticd : 361 x 361
6f: a test case that uses the full arctic grid, but to speed things up vs 6a, we are using a 1 deg "global band" for the global grid, rather than the full 0.5 deg global grid used in 6a. The gbandd_1p0 is deep water. By default, arcticd uses actual bathymetry (not deep water), but the ww3_grid.inp is different from the "arctic" grid used in grdset_a since the boundary input is different.
"tps" version includes winds from an idealized cyclone

summary of gridsets with curvilinear grids (context=computation time):
6a: slow
6d: fast
6e: intermediate
6f: slow (relative to 6a, computation of weights is faster but computation is slower)

Added a grid integration step for gridsets b through f. Output from the computational grids will be interpolated to a global output grid glout.
