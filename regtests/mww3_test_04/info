#  - Note that the outer boundary data is generated by a 1-D model,         #
#  - Options to run this as a one-way nested test from the old test case    #
#    have not been ported to the regtests version.                          #
#  - The square masked version of the old test is not ported eaither.       #
#  - Choice of governing euqations in WAVEWATCH III implies that it is      #
#    not possible to do a purely monochromatic propagation over currents,   #
#    as changes in wavenumbers are modeled as propaption in k-space.        #
