$ Input boundary points ---------------------------------------------- $
$   An unlimited number of lines identifying points at which input 
$   boundary conditions are to be defined. If the actual input data is
$   not defined in the actual wave model run, the initial conditions
$   will be applied as constant boundary conditions. Each line contains:
$     Discrete grid counters (IX,IY) of the active point and a
$     connect flag. If this flag is true, and the present and previous
$     point are on a grid line or diagonal, all intermediate points
$     are also defined as boundary points.

$ Input boundary points from segment data ( FROM = PART ) ------------ $
$   An unlimited number of lines identifying points at which input
$   boundary conditions are to be defined. If the actual input data is

$   will be applied as constant boundary conditions. Each line contains:

$     connect flag. If this flag is true, and the present and previous
$     point are on a grid line or diagonal, all intermediate points

$ Output boundary points --------------------------------------------- $
$ Output boundary points are defined as a number of straight lines,
$ defined by its starting point (X0,Y0), increments (DX,DY) and number
$ of points. A negative number of points starts a new output file.
$ Note that this data is only generated if requested by the actual
$ program. Example again for spherical grid in degrees. Note, these do
$ not need to be defined for data transfer between grids in te multi
$ grid driver.
