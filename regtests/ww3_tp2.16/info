# - This is a simplified version of the global 50km SMC grid, covering the  #
#   area above 65N within the Arcic circle for a quick regression test.     #
#   Corresponding input files are labeled with id 'A50'.                    #
#                                                                           #
#   Output is converted into text files by ww3_outf as type 4 output, which #
#   is added as a new type for all sea points.  Plotting of the output is   #
#   achieved with a proper projection method with the help of the cell      #
#   information files A50SMCels.dat and A50SMCBAr.dat, stored in input/.    #
#   IDL scripts for SMC grid output is available in smc_docs/SMCG_TKs/.     #
#   Regular grid output at the base resolution is also possible as type 3.  #
#                                                                           #
