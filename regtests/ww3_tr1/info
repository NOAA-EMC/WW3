# Remarks :                                                                 #

#  3 tests are provided in seperate input directories:                      #
#    - [input] : A rotated pole grid forced with homogeneous wind that      #
#        outputs boundary conditions on 3 grids with different poles.       #
#                                                                           #
#    - [input_std] : As above, but formulated on a standard pole grid.      #
#                                                                           #
#    - [input_bndin] : A rotated pole grid with input boundary conditions   #
#        on the western edge of the domain. Used to check the correct       #
#        ingestion of nest files (always formulated on a standard pole)     #
#        in to a rotated pole grid.                                         #
#                                                                           #
#  For the first two tests, the rotated and standard pole grids have been   #
#  setup in such a way that the cells on their eastern (sea point) edges    #
#  align at 2.5W (grid north points in the same direction for all grids     #
#  along this longitude). This faciliates the selection of nest output      #
#  points for each output grid as the longitudes are invariant and the      #
#  latitudes vary by the same amount (1 deg).                               #
#                                                                           #
#  Example run_test commands:                                               #
