$ If sub-grid information is available as indicated by FLAGTR above,
$ additional input to define this is needed below. In such cases a
$ field of fractional obstructions at or between grid points needs to
$ be supplied.  First the location and format of the data is defined
$ by (as above) :
$  - Unit number of file (can be 10, and/or identical to bottem depth
$    unit), scale factor for fractional obstruction, IDLA, IDFM,
$    format for formatted read, FROM and filename

$ Input boundary points from segment data ( FROM = PART ) ------------ $
$   An unlimited number of lines identifying points at which input
$   boundary conditions are to be defined. If the actual input data is
$   not defined in the actual wave model run, the initial conditions
$   will be applied as constant boundary conditions. Each line contains:
$     Discrete grid counters (IX,IY) of the active point and a
$     connect flag. If this flag is true, and the present and previous
$     point are on a grid line or diagonal, all intermediate points
$     are also defined as boundary points.
