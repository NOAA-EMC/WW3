#            Parmeterization for the case of two-dimensional propagation    #
#            over half the globe. Based on regtest ww3_tp2.2 with           #

#            Two test cases are run. Both have LMPENABLED, with one which   #

# Notes on LMPN namelist and Langmuir Mixing Parameterization:              #
#                                                                           #
#    The LMPN namelist group configures the Langmuir Mixing                 #
#    Parameterization used within the context of climate modeling and       #
#    when WW3 is coupled with an active ocean model (.e.g., POP2, MOM6).    #
#    The LMPENABLED flag turns on the parameterization computations.        #
#    The SDTAIL flag enables the spectral tail contribution.                #
#    HSLMODE parameter determines the surface layer depth (HSL).            #
#    When HSLMODE == 0, a uniform 10m HSL is assumed for testing purposes.  #
#    When HSLMODE == 1, the HSL field is to be received from the active     #
#    ocean model via coupler.                                               #
#                                                                           #
