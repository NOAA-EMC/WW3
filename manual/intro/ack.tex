The development of \ws\ has been an ongoing process for well over a
decade. The development of WAVEWATCH I was entirely funded through my
Ph.D. work at Delft University. The development of WAVEWATCH II has been
funded entirely through my position as a National Research Council Resident
Research Associate at NASA, Goddard Space Flight Center. The initial
development of WAVEWATCH III version 1.18 was entirely funded by NOAA/NCEP,
with most funding provided by the NOAA High Performance Computing and
Communication (HPCC) office, while I was working as a visiting scientist
through the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR).
Developments of version 2.22 have been funded similarly through
NOAA/NCEP. Since then, funding is provided by NCEP, but also by many partners
outside NCEP. Much of the work at NCEP has been performed under contract by
Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) and IM Systems Group
(IMSG) and their sub-contractors, and by other UCAR visiting scientists.
Special thanks are due to to The Office of Naval Research (ONR), for the
funding of many model upgrades.

I would finally like to thank all users who have reported errors and glitches,
or have made suggestions for improvements, particularly those who have alpha-
and beta-tested this and previous model release.
