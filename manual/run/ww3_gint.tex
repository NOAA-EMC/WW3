\noindent
This post processor program takes field data from several overlapping grids
and produces a unified output file. The different model definition and field
output files are identified by the unique identifier associated with each
specific grid. At this moment the program works with curvilinear and
rectilinear grids. A weights file {\file WHTGRIDINT.bin} is written 
that can be read in subsequent runs using identical origin-destination grids, 
saving substantial time in cases using large number of input grids and/or 
high-resolution target grids.

\noindent
The grid integration program can use linear or nearest interpolation. The latter 
is recommended when partitioned output is used for spectral reconstruction. Linear 
interpolation will result in lines of spurious energy as partitions will bleed and 
artificially increase the total energy.

Note that this program can be used in concert with the grid splitting program
{\file ww3\_gspl}, and that {\file ww3\_gspl.sh} has an option to produce a
template input file for his program (see \para\ref{sub:ww3gspl}).
