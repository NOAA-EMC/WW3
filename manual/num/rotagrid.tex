\noindent
Rotated grid is a latitude-longitdue (lat-lon) grid and is obtained
by rotating the North Pole to a new pole position at latitude $\phi_{p}$
and longitude $\lambda_{p}$ in the standard latitude-longitude system.
The new pole position is chosen so that an interested model domain
may be placed around the rotated equatorial area for a evenly spaced
lat-lon mesh. For this reason the rotated grid is also known as \emph{Equatorial
grid}. For instance, the North Atlantic and European wave (NAEW) model
used in the UK Met Office uses a rotated pole at 37.5N, 177.5E so
that London, UK (\textasciitilde{}51.5N 0.0E) is almost on the rotated
equator. This rotated grid allows a much more evenly spaced lat-lon
mesh in the NAE domain than the standard lat-lon grid in the same
area. In \ws\, the rotated grid is implemeted with minimum changes
to the origianal lat-lon grid. In fact, the rotated grid is treated
just like the standard lat-lon grid inside the  model. Only input
and output files are modified for the rotated grid. Users should choose
the regular lat-lon grid along with the RTD switch to use the rotated
grid. Model input files, like wind, current and ice files should be
mapped on to the rotated grid. For convenience of nesting in standard
lat-lon grid, boundary conditions for the rotated grid use standard
lat-lon grid points, which are converted into rotated grid lat-lon
inside \ws\. List of 2D spectral output locations in ww3\_shel.inp
are also specified in standard lat-lon. All directional output such
as wind direction, peak direction, 2D spectra, etc. are converted
into standard lat-lon orientation. Full grid output are still on rotated
grid but 2D spectra locations have been converted into standard lat-lon.

Four subroutines are provided in module {\bf w3servmd.ftn} for rotated grid
conversion:
\begin{vlist}
\vit{w3spectn}{}{Turns wave spectrum anti-clockwise by AnglD}
\vit{w3acturn}{}{Turns wave action(k,nth) anti-clockwise by AnglD}
\vit{w3lltoeq}{}{Convert standard into rotated lat/lon plus AnglD}
\vit{w3eqtoll}{}{Reverse of w3lltoeq, but AnglD unchanged}
\end{vlist}
These subroutines are self-contained and can be extracted outside
the model for pre- or post-processing of rotated grid files. Some
conversion tools have been developed based on these subroutines but
have not been included in \ws\ yet. Refer to the regression
test \emph{regtests/ww3\_tp2.11} for an example of a rotated grid
model (NAEW) and the document \emph{guide/RotatedGrid.pdf} for rotated
grid formulations. Users may contact \url{Jian-Guo.Li@metoffice.gov.uk}
