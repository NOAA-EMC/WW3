\subsection{~Optimization} \label{sec:optim}
\vssub

The source code of \ws\ is written in ANSI standard FORTRAN 90, and has been
compiled and run on a variety of platforms ranging from PC's to
supercomputers.

Optimization for vector computers has been performed by structuring the code
in long vector loops where possible. Optimization was originally performed for
the Cray YMP and C90. Note that some compiler directives for vectorization
have been used. Note also that the vector optimization has not been updated
since about 1997, and therefore needs to be revisited if the model is
implemented on a vector machine. 

Parallelization for shared memory machines using threading has been
implemented using standard OpenMP directives. Such parallelization takes place
mainly in the loop calling the source term routine {\F w3srce} and the
different propagation routines. OpenMP directives are activated by the
corresponding preprocessor switches ({\F omp}{\it n}).

Parallelization for distributed memory machines is discussed in some detail in
section~\ref{sec:distr}.

Note that an important part of the optimization is the use of interpolation
tables for the solution of the dispersion relation and for the calculation of
the wind-wave interaction parameter.
